# 🧮 MST Visualizer in Java (Prim's & Kruskal's Algorithm)

An interactive Java GUI application that visualizes **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** formation using **Prim's** and **Kruskal's** algorithms. Built using the Java Swing framework, this project helps understand how MSTs are formed step-by-step on a weighted undirected graph.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### ✅ Prim's Algorithm
- Greedy algorithm to find MST
- Starts from any node and grows by adding the smallest edge

### ✅ Kruskal's Algorithm
- Greedy algorithm based on sorting edges by weight
- Uses Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for cycle detection
